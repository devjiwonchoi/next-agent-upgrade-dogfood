# Draft: approval evidence for dynamically rediscovered tools

Unpublished integration note for the pinned EVE 0.52.2 runtime.

ChatJS discovers MCP tools before an EVE step and reopens the authenticated connector when executing a tool. This avoids persisting credentials or live clients in workflow closures and rechecks ownership and tool availability. However, the tool's `needsApproval` policy can change between those requests.

Evaluating a conditional policy during EVE's approval request and independently rediscovering the tool at execution is insufficient: a previously optional tool can become approval-required before execution. Executing the new definition without checking the decision would bypass the new policy.

The local maintained EVE patch exposes an optional `ToolContext.approval` receipt. The harness derives receipts from approval batches resolved in its current invocation and the native allowed settlement audit. A step-local map binds each receipt to the session, call ID, tool name, and exact input. The executor wrapper only exposes a matching receipt, including the authorized responder identity. Old settlement history alone cannot create a receipt; a new invocation replaces the map, and duplicate call identities are rejected. No application approval store or second transcript is added.

The MCP adapter evaluates boolean or conditional policies with validated input, call ID, and the original model messages at request time. At execution it rechecks the current policy against the current server definition. A required policy only proceeds with the native receipt for the owner; newly required approval without a receipt fails before the remote tool executes. A conditional policy returning false does not prompt. Owner-only native response authorization remains in place.

Local tests cover conditional input behavior, policy escalation, foreign responders, schema validation, receipt identity mismatches, missing/old audit state, ambiguous calls, and clearing receipt state. A native harness test uses a deterministic model to resolve an owner approval through the real pending-input coordinator and forward its receipt to the authored executor. A foreign approval remains pending without executing the tool or model. These tests use no remote model or database.

Compiled deployment/resume across worker restarts and real MCP OAuth reconnect still need end-to-end verification. The public shape and step-local lifetime need upstream review before proposing adoption. This draft does not claim that an upstream issue has been published.
