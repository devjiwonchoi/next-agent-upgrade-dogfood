# Draft: terminal session deletion with durable purge completion

Status: local draft for review; not submitted upstream.

## Problem

We are integrating EVE into an existing chat application with conversation deletion, public share links, forked conversations, uploaded files, and tool-created artifacts. We need to retire execution and erase conversation payloads without allowing retries or delayed callbacks to restore the conversation.

In the installed EVE 0.52.2 API, `ClientSession.cancel()` cooperatively cancels work, `clear()` removes model context, and `reset()` terminally retires a session. None advertises physical deletion. Calling reset and removing our application row would leave us without a supported purge contract or a reliable completion signal for erasure.

This is a requested capability, not a claim that reset violates its documented behavior.

## Evidence inspected

Source inspection against the installed EVE 0.52.2 package and its matching local source checkout:

- `src/client/session.ts`: public controls expose cancel, clear, compact, and reset; no delete/purge method.
- `src/execution/workflow-runtime.ts`, `dispatchWorkflowCommand`: reset waits for the session command hook to be released. The return describes retirement, not storage erasure.
- `src/execution/turn-control-receiver.ts`: reset forwards cancellation and buffers a reset control for the active turn.
- `src/execution/workflow-entry.ts`: a parked reset invokes session finalization.
- `src/execution/terminate-child-sessions-step.ts`: cleanup traverses known child handles and cancels indexed tasks; unaddressed starting children are explicitly skipped. This is relevant to defining a stronger deletion barrier, not proof of a reproducible leak.
- The installed `@workflow/world` Storage interface and `@workflow/world-postgres` public API do not expose a general run-payload purge operation.

These findings establish an API gap. We have not yet executed a storage-level erasure reproduction, and do not claim to have enumerated every retained storage object.

### Run inventory needs more than a root-attribute query

Further source inspection identifies an important boundary for a provider implementation:

| Record | Available relationship | Purge implication |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Top-level session | Its own run ID; `buildSessionAttributes` deliberately omits `$eve.root` | Include the session explicitly. |
| Turn | `buildTurnAttributes` supplies `$eve.parent` and `$eve.root`; `dispatch-turn-step.ts` passes them when starting the workflow | These attributes can help inventory descendants without reading every turn payload. |
| Delegated subagent | `buildSubagentRootAttributes` supplies immediate parent and root | Include nested descendants, subject to the retirement barrier. |
| Activity collector | `workflow-runtime.ts` starts it before the session, without explicit lineage attributes, and then places its ID in `WorkflowEntryInput.activityCollectorRunId` | A query using only EVE root attributes is insufficient; retain an explicit collector relationship before erasing the session input. |

Collector creation is conditional on a top-level session needing channel activity renderers. This is source evidence about that path, not a claim that every ChatJS session creates a collector. A failure between collector creation and durable session creation also needs a recovery policy; cancellation alone is not payload erasure.

The installed Postgres provider's `dist/drizzle/schema.js` stores run payloads in `workflow_runs`, plus separate `workflow_events`, `workflow_event_slots`, `workflow_steps`, `workflow_hooks`, `workflow_waits`, and `workflow_stream_chunks`. Stream chunks have a nullable `run_id`, so coverage must account for stream identity as well. This is a list of inspected tables, **not an exhaustive deletion recipe**: queue messages, late writes, sandbox storage, and external references still require investigation. Application code should not infer complete erasure from deleting these rows.

The next implementation boundary is a durable run/resource inventory owned by EVE and its provider. It must include collector relationships, survive retries, and prevent new descendants or writes after retirement. Only then can a provider report completed purge rather than merely successful row deletion.

Our local fork now adds `$eve.activity_collector` to the session's creation attributes when it starts a collector. The source patch and regression test are retained in `patches/eve-collector-inventory.source.patch`. This is an inventory aid for newly created sessions, not the requested purge implementation. It does not address earlier sessions or collectors orphaned before session creation succeeds. Normal writes in the inspected Postgres streamer persist the supplied run ID; the nullable column alone is not evidence that current EVE writes omit it.

Workflow's `runtime/start.js`, `resolveLineageAttributes`, also records `$parentRunId` and `$rootRunId` from the ambient step context. These relationships matter beyond EVE's own tags: our local retired chat fixture has a terminal session, a cancelled timeout run, and a completed turn linked by native Workflow metadata. The local read-only Postgres inventory adapter follows both native and EVE parent edges plus the collector reference, without returning payload columns. It reports active runs, missing referenced runs, and stream names containing chunks from outside the inventory or without run attribution. A repeatable-read snapshot makes those reads consistent, but does not prevent future writes or prove coverage of unlinked resources. It is not a purge receipt.

## Requested contract

A native, retryable deletion operation should provide:

1. An immediate, durable fence on the exact session identity. New sends, responses, task starts, forks from the session, and late delivery attempts must not recreate it.
2. An explicit retirement phase that waits for active tools/tasks and known child work to stop. In-flight child creation needs a defined handoff to the deletion operation.
3. A durable deletion receipt distinguishing accepted, retiring, purging, completed, and failed/retryable outcomes. A caller timeout must not imply cancellation of deletion or successful erasure.
4. Defined purge coverage for transcript events, workflow inputs/outputs, step results, streams, task records, hooks, sandbox state/snapshots, and continuation or idempotency payloads.
5. Storage-provider support with an explicit unsupported response where purge cannot be guaranteed. Avoid silently interpreting reset as deletion.
6. A minimal tombstone or equivalent fence that prevents resurrection after payload erasure, with documented retention and no original conversation text.
7. A documented boundary for application-owned artifacts, billing receipts, shared links, and independent conversation forks. The application must be able to retain minimal accounting records while deleting conversation content.

The exact API shape is open. A possible shape is an idempotent session deletion request returning an operation ID, with a separate status read. An application should not have to delete undocumented Workflow Postgres tables directly.

## Acceptance scenarios

- Delete a parked session twice; both requests converge on one completed deletion.
- Delete during a streaming tool and during child/task creation; delayed completions cannot restore content.
- Retry after a request timeout and after a worker restart; progress and final status remain recoverable.
- Attempt send/respond/fork with old session and operation identifiers after completion; content cannot be recreated.
- Inspect the supported World's storage for a unique marker from message, tool input, and tool output; those payloads are absent after purge completion.
- Verify the published policy for independent forks and shared sandbox/blob references; deleting one conversation must not corrupt surviving conversations.
- Preserve separately owned accounting totals without preserving transcript or tool payloads.
- Exercise an activity-rendering session and verify the collector's payloads are included, including recovery when session startup fails after collector creation.
- Verify stream coverage when a chunk has no run ID, and ensure delayed queue delivery cannot restore erased data.

## Application integration boundary

ChatJS still needs its own deletion record and access fence to remove history visibility and revoke shares immediately, coordinate application-owned file/document cleanup, and preserve accounting. Those responsibilities do not require EVE to own ChatJS metadata. EVE should own retirement and purge of the transcript/execution data it persists.

Local Postgres tests now exercise a provider extension in `apps/chat/lib/db/eve-resource-fence.ts`. It installs insert/update guards for the inspected run, event, step, hook, wait, event-slot, and stream tables. Writers hold shared locks on resource-ID records through commit; fencing updates those records and waits for admitted writers. Tests verify rejection of later writes and replay after fixture payload deletion, transaction rollback for active runs or ambiguous streams, and rejection from an older repeatable-read snapshot. The normal browser chat/retirement test also passes with these guards installed locally.

This extension is an explicit provider migration primitive, not automatically installed by an application request or application database migration. It adds a small registry row per observed run/stream identity and row-lock work to writes. It currently fences only the caller's known resource set: it does not establish a complete family inventory barrier, fence Graphile queue payloads, delete sandbox/blob data, or report completed erasure. Those remain integration requirements before enabling full conversation deletion.

The local session coordinator now closes the inventory-to-fence race for the reachable native graph in one READ COMMITTED transaction. It fences the root, reads and fences descendants/streams, and re-reads after waiting for their admitted writers until no new resources appear. Active runs, missing references, ambiguous streams, or failure to stabilize roll back the transaction. A local concurrency test verifies that a collector child and its stream committed while the collector fence waits are included on the next pass. This still does not prove coverage of unlinked resources, queues, sandboxes, or blobs.

The installed provider's `message.js` and `queue.js` encode Graphile message bodies as base64 JSON. `WorkflowInvokePayloadSchema.runInput.attributes` can identify a queued child before its run row exists. Our local queue inventory decodes that envelope inside Postgres, scopes it to the explicitly configured task identifier, and returns job/run IDs, lock status, and unsupported-job IDs. Tests cover those queued children, unrelated jobs, health probes, locks, and invalid encoding. No queue payload contents are returned to the application. This remains a snapshot: enqueue fencing and transactional removal are still needed. Graphile's `complete_jobs` removes eligible jobs and returns fewer rows when some cannot be removed; its age-based lock eligibility is not proof that a worker has stopped, so cleanup must explicitly handle live locks rather than blindly treating completion as erasure.

All reproduction and implementation tests use local Postgres. No production data or legacy conversation migration is involved.

The local queue extension now guards enqueue and payload/task replacement for explicitly registered Workflow task identifiers. It checks both old and new run associations, including resilient creation attributes, through the same resource fence. Workers may still update bookkeeping when the stored payload text is unchanged. Queue cleanup requires installed fences, discovers queued descendants to a fixed point, rechecks worker ownership under row locks, and uses Graphile's completion function only for unlocked jobs. Discovered run IDs are persisted atomically with removal so retries do not lose their association after queued content disappears. Tests verify nested queued children, unrelated-job preservation, repeat cleanup, protected payload replacement, and refusal to remove even an old worker lock. The local browser chat/retirement flow passes with the queue guard enabled. Unlinked resources, sandbox/blob cleanup, and application completion coordination remain separate work; this is not full session-erasure evidence.

The local native-payload primitive now requires terminal, unambiguous run/stream inventory, all corresponding write fences, and an empty registered queue. It includes run identities retained by queue cleanup and deletes the inspected native payload tables in one transaction with an identity-only retry receipt. Local database tests verify unrelated-session isolation, queue-clearance enforcement, late-write rejection, and retries after the root row is gone. The browser retirement test now also exercises native deletion and retries while checking that settled credits stay unchanged. This is still an internal provider primitive, not a complete application deletion endpoint or proof of sandbox/blob and unlinked-resource erasure.

The local native cleanup coordinator now serializes attempts per session and commits a retirement receipt before fencing. Retries resume without resetting a fenced or erased session. Queue-discovered identities feed back into graph and stream fencing; newly discovered descendants trigger another queue pass. Local tests cover failed retirement, downstream failure, concurrent attempts, detached streams, and retries after payload erasure. A browser test verifies the real retirement-to-purge path and unchanged settled credits on retry. Application authorization, document/file cleanup, sandbox coverage, and final deletion status still need the full application coordinator.

## Sandbox deletion evidence and integration order

Inspected the local EVE 0.52.2 source and ChatJS fork patches. These findings are source evidence; they are not a completed sandbox-erasure test.

- `execution/sandbox/ensure.ts` lazily creates or reattaches the sandbox. Its `delete` method calls `getHandle()` before deleting, so invoking it without an initialized handle can provision or restore a sandbox. Cleanup needs a resource-based operation that does not create resources merely to remove them.
- `execution/sandbox/bindings/microsandbox-runtime.ts` explicitly preserves the stopped VM during `shutdown` for later reconnect. Process shutdown is not sandbox erasure.
- `microsandbox-lifecycle.ts` implements handle deletion with `shutdown` followed by `removePersisted`. `removePersisted` removes the live VM and the current `stateSnapshotName`; session metadata records those identities and the options hash.
- ChatJS's **local fork-checkpoint extension** creates separate `eve-sbx-fork-*` snapshots in `captureForkCheckpoint`. They are not listed in the session metadata interface or removed by `removePersisted`. This checkpoint-retention gap belongs to our extension; do not report it as an unmodified upstream EVE defect.
- Fork restore can depend on a source checkpoint. Removing it when only the source is retired would be unsafe. ChatJS deletes the whole conversation family, so cleanup must first retire every member and preserve the complete set of checkpoint identities.

The application coordinator must inventory sandbox resources **before** calling native payload purge: the state carrying resource identities may otherwise disappear. Preserve a durable manifest of owned VM, state-snapshot, and fork-checkpoint identities; then fence/retire the family, remove those resources with retry-safe provider operations, and only mark application deletion complete after provider confirmation. Shared bootstrap templates are outside the family manifest and must remain intact. Missing or ambiguous ownership must leave deletion pending rather than trigger global sandbox or snapshot pruning.

The local fork now records each checkpoint identity in a private JSON file alongside sandbox metadata before provider lookup or creation. Atomic rename prevents partial records, retries use the same identity, and failed capture retains the record. These local records are not a remote durable manifest or coverage for older snapshots. Next implementation: provide deletion by recorded provider identity without restoring a VM, and test restart/retry plus an unrelated surviving family's sandbox. The existing native-payload coordinator remains an internal stage and must not be treated as the complete deletion endpoint.

The local-provider cleanup helper now validates session metadata and every published fork manifest before any provider action. It removes the recorded VM by provider handle, then its current state snapshot and recorded fork snapshots without forced deletion. Recognized missing-resource responses make retries idempotent; other errors leave cleanup pending and identity records intact. A local acceptance test creates an isolated real VM, state/fork snapshots, and an unrelated snapshot, verifies removal and retry, and confirms the unrelated snapshot survives. Full-family ordering, application authorization, old-resource discovery, and remote durable inventory remain integration requirements.

Local sandbox cleanup now accepts the whole family inventory, validates every member before provider actions, and destroys all recorded VMs before processing snapshots. It uses the exact Microsandbox handle’s `destroy()` operation to stop and remove a running VM; `remove()` alone rejects live VMs and leaves deletion pending. Same-name replacements remain protected by the provider identity check. ChatJS externalizes `microsandbox` in Next.js so route handlers load its native binding through Node instead of bundling it; direct Bun validation alone did not catch the HTTP loading failure. Non-forced snapshot removal proceeds in passes so recorded children can be removed before blocked parents; a pass with no progress returns the provider failures instead of looping indefinitely. A real-provider test restores a child VM from a parent fork snapshot, captures child state, removes both members, retries, and verifies an unrelated snapshot survives. Family membership discovery and application-level retirement authorization remain the coordinator's responsibility.

The maintained local fork now also writes immutable VM and state-snapshot identities before provider creation, including VM restore and network-policy replacement. Those records are separate from the latest reconnect metadata, so replacement does not lose old identities and a failed final metadata write does not hide a newly created resource. Cleanup validates and retains these records, deduplicates their identities, and removes all recorded VMs before snapshots. Fork manifests are scoped by session and immutable snapshot identity; a later configuration hash must not hide earlier checkpoints belonging to that same session.

A real EVE-backend acceptance test captures a checkpoint, edits the parent's file, restores a child with the original file contents, captures state snapshots, removes the child's reconnect metadata, and verifies cleanup of both VMs and all recorded snapshots plus retry. Source tests verify that a failed resource-record write prevents VM creation and that a failed provider snapshot capture retains its identity. These tests use isolated local VM resources and no database. This closes the inspected local creation-before-record gap for new session resources; it does not recover older unrecorded resources, establish application family membership, or provide remote durable inventory.

Before calling the local microsandbox backend, the fork now publishes an immutable `owner.json` containing the original native session ID and sandbox key. Publishing a complete record without replacement rejects a different owner before provider access, including key collisions caused by sanitization. ChatJS's local inventory reader selects exact native session IDs across sandbox versions and reports missing, malformed, mismatched, or symlinked entries separately. The coordinator still needs the authorized native family, an inventory barrier, and a policy for older unattributed directories; the reader alone is not proof of complete resource coverage.

The local fork now guards resource-changing backend operations with admission records under a native-session scope. An operation publishes its record before checking the permanent deletion marker and retains it through the awaited provider call. Deletion publishes markers for every member before checking for outstanding operations, preventing new sandbox versions from bypassing the family barrier. VM creation/reconnection, checkpoint and state capture, and network-policy replacement participate. Temporary bootstrap resources remain outside session cleanup.

Tests cover an admitted operation surviving the fence until completion, rejection of later work, whole-family marking before pending-work checks, and real-backend refusal to reopen or capture a new checkpoint after fencing. Records are never expired by age: a process loss can leave an unresolved admission, and safe reconciliation of that state is still required before the complete deletion coordinator is enabled. This mechanism is local-filesystem coordination, not a remote-provider deletion protocol.

The internal local-resource coordinator now composes family retirement, native preparation, the local mutation fence, sandbox inventory/removal, document erasure, and file-reference cleanup. It retains native history and the application's `deleting` state so external tool resources can be accounted for before final completion. In particular, ChatJS's code-execution tool creates a separate Vercel sandbox; that resource path is not covered by the local EVE sandbox inventory.

For older local directories without ownership records, the reader uses the pinned key format only to exclude a canonical, unrelated native ULID under the current app's realpath-derived scope. It never uses a key to authorize erasure. Possible family members, malformed ownership, truncated IDs, and unknown scopes remain unresolved. The browser acceptance test runs the composed cleanup through Bun against the actual app root and local Postgres, verifies document removal and retry, and checks that the native run and pending deletion state remain until later erasure.

A failed local sandbox setup can leave only an ownership record. New directories now carry `writeAheadResources: true` in that record, declaring that resource identities have been recorded before provider I/O from the directory's inception. Cleanup accepts an empty inventory only with this declaration and no snapshot evidence. Existing directories are never upgraded to this declaration, and retries preserve the original record. Source integration tests cover fresh versus preexisting directories; application tests cover empty-attempt retry and refusal of old, foreign, or incomplete inventory.

## Updated external code-execution sandbox findings (2026-09-11)

The initial audit found the separate ChatJS code-execution tool using `@vercel/sandbox` 1.9.3, which could not select a name before allocation. The application has since upgraded to pinned 3.3.0. Its disposable sandboxes explicitly disable persistence, and cleanup awaits stop and deletion with independent timeouts. Native code calls now derive an opaque, stable resource name from the authenticated owner, native session, and call ID.

Real JavaScript and Python SDK lifecycle tests verified execution and subsequent lookup-by-name returning not found. Native browser tests verified rendered output, once-only billing, and reload. These establish normal cleanup, not recovery from a worker crash or an uncertain create response. That remaining window is separate from EVE's own VM inventory.

Do not report named-resource recovery as a missing capability in the current Sandbox SDK. The published 3.3.0 package now exposes:

- `Sandbox.create({ name, persistent, ... })` and `Sandbox.get({ name })`.
- `Sandbox.getOrCreate({ name, ... })`; its implementation can delete and recreate a named sandbox on `snapshot_not_found`, so it is inappropriate for a deletion reconciliation path that must never create new resources.
- `sandbox.delete({ deleteOrphanSnapshots, signal })`. Orphan snapshot deletion is explicitly asynchronous and defaults to false. A resolved delete call must not be presented as proof that every previously created snapshot has been erased.
- Persistence enabled by default. Our disposable code-execution tool now explicitly sets `persistent: false`.
- `stop({ signal })`, without the 1.x `blocking` option. Our cleanup now uses the new signature and attempts deletion even if stopping fails.

Initial audit evidence: then-installed 1.9.3 declarations, published 3.3.0 `dist/sandbox.d.ts` and `dist/sandbox.js`, and the official [SDK reference](https://vercel.com/docs/sandbox/sdk-reference) and [persistence announcement](https://vercel.com/changelog/sandbox-persistence-is-now-ga). The source audit did not allocate, list, stop, or delete any remote sandbox.

The next implementation must durably record the stable name and its owner/conversation association before allocation, and use lookup-only recovery plus deletion fences. Keep EVE's own SDK dependency and VM provider separate until their compatibility is checked. Persist unresolved allocation intent even when creation times out. Do not mark conversation erasure complete while a creation operation can still finish after the cleanup barrier, or while an older resource has no verified ownership record.

The SDK upgrade and stable naming are implemented. Allocation ownership is recorded as described below; crash recovery and full conversation erasure verification remain incomplete. The existing `resolveEveConversationScope` helper already handles first-turn binding delay for generated files; sandbox registration should reuse that trusted scope and the owner-family deletion lock. Retain unresolved allocation intent instead of assuming a timeout proves no resource exists. No provider issue is ready for publication on this evidence alone.

### Durable allocation ownership (local implementation)

`EveCodeSandbox` now records the stable provider name, trusted conversation, owner, and call before allocation. Reservation shares the owner-family lock with deletion. Duplicate reservations cannot allocate again, and unknown creation outcomes retain unresolved intent. Normal tool cleanup marks ownership deleted only after provider stop/deletion succeeds; a failed cleanup retains it. Final application deletion refuses any unresolved sandbox in the family.

Local database tests cover foreign ownership, duplicate calls, deletion races, and the final-erasure guard. A real SDK/local-database test executes code, verifies the released record, and confirms provider lookup by name returns 404. Confirmed creation is now recorded before executing code. After native family retirement, the coordinator can recover a sandbox whose successful creation was recorded but whose cleanup did not complete. It uses lookup without resume, rejects unexpected identity or persistence, and confirms absence after cleanup. A real SDK/local-database test covers this abandoned-resource path and retry.

Unconfirmed creation remains unresolved: lookup of its name must not be treated as proof that a still-pending create cannot finish later. This includes a crash between the successful provider reply and committing creation confirmation. Older unindexed code sandboxes also remain outside this ownership guarantee.

### Integrated local family deletion

The internal `deleteLocalEveConversationFamily` entry point now composes resource cleanup, native payload purge, and final application tombstones in that order. Failures retain pending deletion; retirement and purge receipts allow retry after partial native erasure. A local PostgreSQL test deletes through a fork, checks that both family members lose their native and application payloads, retries, and verifies an unrelated conversation survives. An uncertain sandbox allocation blocks the sequence before native erasure.

This is an internal local-provider entry point, not an enabled deletion API. Deployment/provider wiring, crash-left local mutation admissions, unconfirmed allocations, and older unattributed resources still need resolution before claiming complete user-facing deletion support.

The pinned EVE `selectDefaultSandbox` implementation selects Vercel when `VERCEL` is set, otherwise Docker when available, then microsandbox on supported platforms, then just-bash. A development server alone therefore does not prove microsandbox ownership. Local inventory now refuses other backend cache entries and linked provider roots rather than silently ignoring them. This catches local evidence of mixed providers; absence of those entries does not prove that remote resources never existed. API wiring must establish the actual provider and worker storage root for the sessions being erased before using this local coordinator.

### Native provider identity

The unused application backend wrapper and its opt-in configuration were removed. The maintained native creation path records the actual selected provider and worker root before provider access. The deletion coordinator validates those receipts and matching local records rather than introducing another provider selection layer.

Introducing an authored sandbox can change EVE's source-derived sandbox keys; earlier versions and their ownership records must remain in the deletion inventory. Before exposing cleanup, every native family member needs an immutable provider and worker-root identity recorded at its creation, before any sandbox/provider operation, with later execution refusing a different identity. Sessions predating that record must remain unsupported until their resource history is explicitly reconciled. A first-use backend wrapper cannot retroactively supply that proof: EVE's current `ensureSandboxAccess` drops old reconnect metadata when the backend name or session key changes. Neither an empty local cache nor missing `existingMetadata` excludes prior remote resources.

Response groups now retain candidate operation identities separately from their request hash and model-selection payload. Family retirement tombstones related groups under the same owner lock used by group and conversation reservation, clears that payload, and prevents even an unstarted candidate from being replayed as a standalone conversation. Groups with a source but no started candidates are included through an explicit source association. Groups created before this association contract block deletion until replay of the exact saved request recovers their source; unknown scope is never inferred from absent candidates. Local PostgreSQL tests cover partial groups, an in-flight candidate, concurrent reservation/retirement, unrelated groups, and direct candidate replay.

### Local session-birth identity (implementation in progress)

The maintained native patch now records the resolved backend and canonical worker root during local `createSessionStep`, before any session sandbox access. It publishes the sidecar atomically, preserves the identity through durable projection/hydration, and rejects a changed backend/root before template waits or allocation. Fork creation records the child's identity instead of copying the source's. Hosted and historical sessions are not retroactively certified.

Native tests cover concurrent publication, conflicting retry, canonical aliases, provider/root drift, durable round trips, and independent fork identities. The record is not yet a deletion authorization: the coordinator must verify native birth evidence and descendant coverage. The version 2 contract described below now prevents older snapshot consumers from silently discarding the identity. Cross-host attempts whose creation step never committed also need authoritative reconciliation; a local sidecar alone cannot prove that the eventual session ran on that host. The user-facing deletion API remains disabled until these requirements and allocation recovery are handled.

### Versioned native birth evidence

Durable snapshots now use version 2 so older consumers reject a shape whose identity they would otherwise discard. The v1 migration preserves conversation history but removes the unverified local identity; it cannot establish a new provider-history guarantee retroactively. New session creation emits a receipt into `eve.sandbox-identity`, with its native session ID, snapshot version, and local identity (or null for a hosted attempt), before any session tool work. A failed receipt write fails creation. Retries may emit duplicates, so a deletion reader must require matching receipts and reject conflicting local/hosted attempts. The native fork regression verifies independent source and child receipts.

The remaining coordinator work is to read this evidence under retirement/write fences, validate every owning descendant and its local sidecar, and retain that proof across partial purge retries. This is not yet a user-facing deletion API.

New drivers validate both the creation handle and embedded snapshot version before starting a turn. An older creation worker cannot bypass the contract by ignoring the receipt-writer input and returning a v1 result. Focused tests cover mismatched handle/snapshot versions, missing snapshots, future versions, failed receipt publication, and historical checkpoint restoration without retroactive identity.

The internal native birth reader is now implemented and exercised against real parent and forked session streams. It accepts identical retry records but rejects any conflicting or uncertified attempt, including hosted attempts following a local attempt. Reads have a finite prefix, a 100-record limit, and a 10-second deadline; cancellation cannot delay a timeout. This primitive intentionally does not authorize erasure. The application coordinator must still read it under writer fences, account for every sandbox-owning descendant, match local sidecar evidence, and persist verified ownership before deleting native payloads.

The birth reader is now reachable through an authenticated read-only native sandbox-identity route. ChatJS restricts that route to an owner-matched session already pending deletion, and denies ordinary session access and mutation verbs. The installed-package regression checks the response contract and rejection of a hosted retry after local evidence. Descendant authorization and persisting verified family coverage remain prerequisites for using it in the erasure coordinator.

The native inventory now includes each run's workflow name for explicit resource coverage classification. A queue-discovered run whose native row is missing is reported as incomplete ownership, rather than silently omitted: a missing row cannot prove the run never allocated external resources. Local database tests verify preparation and retries remain blocked without erasing payloads, while ordinary cleanup and retries after a completed purge still succeed.

Sandbox coverage now classifies the pinned workflow identities in the native inventory. Each `workflowEntry` is a session requiring its own birth receipt; turn, timeout, and pinned sleep runs are covered only when every parent path resolves through known workflow types to such a session. Missing ancestry, cycles, unknown versions, collectors, and authored workflow wrappers remain unresolved. Graph traversal visits each ancestry edge once and does not authorize erasure; the coordinator still needs receipt validation and persistent proof.

The internal local coordinator now enforces coverage before sandbox, document, or file erasure. Under the same advisory lock as native payload deletion, it requires a complete classified run inventory and fences for every run and stream, then verifies each session's native v2 birth receipt against its canonical local microsandbox identity file. Identity files cannot be symlinks. Descendant reads require an owner-matched deleting root plus fenced native ancestry, including queue-retained associations.

A provider-side `eve_sandbox_coverage` row records the verified worker root, run IDs and sandbox-owning session IDs before native erasure. Retries require the same scope and can proceed after native payloads are gone without rereading lost birth streams. The table is installed explicitly with the local provider fence migration; no request creates it. Local database tests cover missing fences, failed verification, unknown workflows, foreign descendants, and changed retry scope. The browser retirement test now uses Gemini Flash Lite and verifies composed cleanup again after native erasure with settled credits unchanged. Unknown authored workflow coverage and uncertain external allocations remain unresolved; this is still an internal coordinator, not the public deletion UI.

ChatJS now exposes owner-only deletion/status endpoints for the verified local configuration. DELETE operates on the conversation family and reports completed, pending with an explicit retry requirement, or not started. GET reads status without resuming work; completed tombstones support idempotent retries. Foreign origins and ownership are rejected. Hosted-provider configurations are refused before access revocation. Browser tests cover both retry after native erasure and full retirement/erasure initiated by the API for a fresh conversation. The sidebar action and hosted-provider cleanup are still outstanding.
