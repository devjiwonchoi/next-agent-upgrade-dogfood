# ChatJS → EVE migration report

Report updated: 14 September 2026. This report retains the historical validation record for the EVE migration and records the EVE-only release boundary below.

## Status and scope

EVE is the only ChatJS application runtime. The normal routes, composer, sidebar, artifacts, sharing, projects, and conversation history use EVE; the legacy AI SDK chat runtime, local message stores, transport routes, and scaffold vendoring path are removed. `@chat-js/thread` remains a standalone package with its own reference documentation and is not copied into generated ChatJS apps.

This report does not claim production readiness. Provider deletion coverage and guest-hosting readiness remain release gates owned by the current implementation and deployment review. The historical evidence below may describe the earlier feature-gated rollout and should not be read as a dual-runtime contract.

The integration incorporates main’s Oxfmt/Oxlint migration and optional shadcn registry architecture. Formatting was normalized before merging. The generated model catalog has since been restored byte-for-byte to main and excluded from general formatting; its earlier approximately 8,500 changed lines were whitespace, not an EVE model-catalog update. Installed AI SDK tools provide their own schemas and renderers; the EVE adapter supplies execution context, cancellation, owned file storage, sandbox identity and usage accounting. The old platform factory implementations are removed. Final checks must cover both the reference app and generated apps with optional capabilities absent.

Historical ChatJS conversations are not imported into EVE. Saving a copy of an **EVE public share** is implemented and is separate from importing legacy data.

## Latest EVE-only cleanup and validation

The new-package release boundary uses `0000_eve_baseline.sql`, containing 31 current tables, instead of carrying legacy schema history into fresh installations. The migrator refuses unknown histories and existing untracked ChatJS tables before applying migrations. Existing development databases were left untouched; validation used newly provisioned local application and workflow databases.

Legacy routes/controllers/stores, Redis support, old anonymous-session machinery, legacy schema and scaffold thread vendoring are removed. EVE is required in development and production. Standalone `packages/thread`, its dedicated docs and its website demo remain unchanged. The generated build retains the baseline migration step before `eve build` and `next build`.

Latest checks passed: 583 app unit tests, 86 CLI unit tests, all seven workspace type-check tasks, lint/docs checks and template consistency. An independently installed Vercel-gateway scaffold passed installation, lint and types. The fresh PostgreSQL baseline and repeat migration passed. A local Node-server production build/start passed live Gemini Flash Lite messaging, transcript reload and read-only sharing. The EVE fork now starts its production worker during Next configuration evaluation; 20 focused upstream Next integration tests passed, and the new compiled patch changes only that integration module.

Desktop/mobile message-presentation captures were reviewed. The retained model-selector fixture has two meaningful states, closed and open; updated macOS baselines were inspected and their comparison passed. **Two Linux selector baselines still need regeneration. Linux Playwright CI is not expected to pass until those baselines are supplied.** The CI workflow now bootstraps its own EVE workflow database.

This does not close the maintained-fork source-test/build-equivalence gate, hosted deletion/guest-hosting acceptance, Docker image validation or scale/retention work. Nothing has been released, deployed to production or published upstream.

```

- **EVE:** messages, execution, approvals, turn identity, restored history, checkpoints and workflow state. The browser uses EVE's native reducer/stream.
- **ChatJS:** authentication, session ownership, operation admission/recovery, titles/pins/projects/sharing/votes, quota and billing ledgers, file ownership, document revisions, deletion inventories and receipts.
- **Providers:** model calls, object storage and sandbox resources. Their lifetime requires explicit accounting and cleanup beyond deleting a conversation row.

There is no ongoing synchronization of two independently authoritative chat transcripts. Creation intents, copy preparation and checkpoint references do persist recovery material; documents also retain their own revision history. Those are deliberate domain records, not a second live conversation engine. Public sharing uses an allowlisted projection of native content rather than exposing the native session API to anonymous readers.

Key entry points: [agent](../apps/chat/agent/agent.ts), [gateway](../apps/chat/app/api/eve/[...path]/route.ts), [conversation UI](../apps/chat/components/eve/eve-conversation.tsx), and [application procedures](../apps/chat/trpc/routers/eve.router.ts).

## What migrated

| Area | Implemented behavior | Important boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| App integration | `/`, `/chat/[id]`, project chats, sidebar, composer and artifacts use EVE; `/agent` redirects into the normal app | There is no legacy runtime fallback |
| Sending and recovery | Immediate composer clearing on accepted send; retained intent for uncertain delivery; reload/retry with stable operation identity; explicit rejection restores editable input | A lost response is not treated as proof that creation failed |
| Streaming and lifecycle | Durable reload/resume, checkpoints, native pending input, approval continuation and cancellation | Worker/provider availability is still required; local supervision is not hosted availability |
| Models | Existing model picker, validated per-turn model selection, durable response provenance, regeneration with original model | The available catalog and credentials still govern usable models |
| Comparisons | Multiple native candidate sessions, initial and follow-up comparisons, candidate selection, retained drafts and recoverable admission | Separate native executions incur separate usage |
| Attachments | Owned uploads, image/PDF input, durable references, previews after reload, multipart recovery, inherited files during editing/copying | Validation is for supported file/model paths, not every advertised provider or MIME type |
| Edit/regenerate/forks | Checkpoints at turn boundaries, fresh branch execution, history restoration, version navigation, ancestor-aware edits and original response models | This uses substantial maintained EVE checkpoint/fork support with bounds below |
| History and metadata | EVE-only paginated/searchable history, rename, pin, ownership isolation | Legacy history stays hidden |
| Projects | Create/rename/remove, instructions, project-scoped conversations, moving chats, removal detaches surviving chats | Registered-user organization; guests do not gain registered project access |
| Sharing | Public read-only projection, private/foreign access rejection, revocation, safe tool/file/document exposure | Public access is not access to native execution or private metadata |
| Save a copy | Durable copy preparation, no generation just to copy, retry after lost reply/source revocation, independent attachments/documents and later continuation/edit/regenerate | This is a sanitized conversation copy, not cloning provider credentials or live execution |
| Feedback | Owner-only assistant votes, reload persistence, error recovery, shared UI states | Private voting metadata excluded from public shares |
| Tools | ChatJS installed/custom tools and shared validated renderers; native optional defaults disabled; selected-tool policy retained per turn | Only configured tools are exposed; generic unreviewed EVE defaults do not bypass ChatJS policy |
| Search and research | Search progress/sources; native research pipeline, clarifications, durable reports and usage | Depends on configured search/model providers |
| Code and charts | Native sandbox execution, real output, Python chart rendering, document Run, fixed tool-charge reconciliation | Provider sandbox identity and cleanup must be provable |
| Documents/artifacts | Native tool creation, revision history, autosave/recovery, manual edits, comparisons, copy actions, assistant actions, auto-open, share and fork isolation | App document state is checkpointed alongside native conversation boundaries |
| Images | Native generation/editing, durable generated files, reload and shared results | Actual image provider has its own pricing and availability |
| Video | Adapter, schemas and renderer support are present | Disabled by existing product defaults; no claim of live paid-video end-to-end validation |
| MCP | Authenticated discovery/execution, schema validation, connector controls, result rendering, OAuth callback/refresh/reconnect, native execution receipts | Arbitrary server/provider interoperability and resumed approval-policy scenarios are not exhaustively tested |
| Guest use | Stateless bootstrap, isolated history, configured model/tool policy, atomic quota admission, follow-ups/comparisons and retry-safe reservations | No registered-user credit row is created; guest policy may expose fewer tools |
| Billing | Event-idempotent usage, primary/auxiliary/compaction costs, provider reconciliation and durable cursors, separate guest accounting | Positive-credit admission is not a hard concurrent-spend reservation |
| Deletion | Owner-visible pending/deleted state, immediate access fence, family-wide inventory, retryable native retirement, files/documents/sandboxes/queue payload cleanup and durable tombstones | Complete erasure is implemented for the explicitly supported local provider configuration, not arbitrary hosted worlds |
| Expiry and orphan cleanup | Guest-family expiry, bounded fair retries, retained billing identity, orphan upload ownership/fences | Automatic scheduler is development/loopback-only |
| Developer operation | Single app/EVE startup, bounded health checks, macOS supervision, restart backoff and heap limits | Laptop sleep, database failure and remote provider outages remain real availability limits |
| Generated apps | Patched runtime vendoring and validation during scaffold/template generation; shared registry tool schemas/renderers | EVE, MCP and the Postgres world are vendored; `@chat-js/thread` is not copied into the app scaffold; hosted/generated-app deployment still needs rehearsal |

## Complications encountered and resolutions

1. **Backend-only integration would have created competing state owners.** The chosen implementation uses `useEveAgent` through the existing ChatJS UI. App metadata is indexed separately, while native conversation state remains EVE's.
2. **Sending could look stuck or lose visible intent on reload.** Composer state and durable creation identity now distinguish acceptance, explicit rejection and unknown delivery. Recovery reuses the operation; guests replay admitted requests before volatile quota/model/file preflight can invalidate them.
3. **Fork/edit behavior needed more than replaying visible messages.** Native checkpoints carry model history and compatible resource snapshots; display history is restored without replaying execution or charging copied turns. Named idle checkpoints enable later comparisons/copies without a dummy turn.
4. **Approval continuation lacked a valid turn identity.** A maintained EVE guard opens the required turn for continuation, preserving usage attribution.
5. **Pending work could block cancellation in Postgres workflows.** The world patch removes serialization between distinct deliveries while retaining exact delivery deduplication.
6. **Deletion spans much more than app rows.** Native sessions, child/collector runs, streams, queued work, documents, shared file references and provider resources require fences and retry receipts. Unknown resource ownership or uncertain allocation leaves deletion pending rather than reporting erasure.
7. **Repeated billing reads consumed excessive database transfer.** Reconciliation now tracks durable cursors and skips unchanged streams; the Postgres reader patch resumes after the consumed boundary. After the Neon quota warning, verification moved to isolated local Postgres. This report performs no Neon reads. It does not claim a measured production bandwidth budget.
8. **Generated apps must receive the exact maintained runtime.** Bun patch/cache behavior required relocated helper files, installed-byte verification and vendored tarballs, rather than assuming a successful install proved the patch. The main integration closes the missing Postgres world archive gap; all three patches are verified and vendored.
9. **MCP OAuth refreshes raced.** Connector-scoped serialization and token reuse protect rotation across fresh clients. A separate SDK SSE patch coalesces refresh and handles late 401 responses. Tokens/credentials are not persisted inside workflow closures or copied into public transcripts.
10. **Browser tests exposed fixture drift.** Old model aliases, changed recovery text, an unintended model-selected approval tool, too-short deletion cleanup, and an obsolete one-row billing assumption were corrected in the latest parity tests. The extra billing row was an independently recorded follow-up suggestion call. These were not all product failures, and failures were not simply rerun until green without examining them.

## Maintained patches and technical debt

| Debt/workaround | Why it exists | Exit condition / risk |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `eve@0.52.2` compiled dependency and readable source patches | Approval continuation, native checkpoints/forks/restored history, idle seeds, approval receipts, resource/birth/inventory support | Upstream or a published maintained fork must replace them with equivalent contracts and migration tests. Browser and worker must use matching patched wire versions |
| `@workflow/world-postgres@5.0.0-beta.40` patch | Cancellation delivery and efficient resumed-stream reads | Re-evaluate on upstream upgrade; concurrency/deduplication and transfer regressions need explicit tests |
| `@ai-sdk/mcp@2.0.52` patch | Single-flight SSE auth recovery and late-401 handling | Replace after upstream equivalent lands; test rotating credentials across fresh and established clients |
| Patched runtime distribution | Scaffold and template sync now verify and vendor EVE, MCP and Postgres Workflow World together | Keep clean-install and archive-presence checks when upgrading any patched package |
| Direct Postgres stream-position reads | Efficient billing reconciliation currently uses pinned World schema/stream naming | Replace with a supported authorized batch-position API; schema upgrades need adapter/regression review |
| Local SQL resource fences/inventories/retirement | Safe erasure is not a single upstream delete call | Hosted/provider-portable deletion needs separate design and certification; setup is an explicit local migration |
| Checkpoint snapshots and copy journals | Restore history/resources without a second execution authority | Full snapshots can grow quadratically; retention/compaction/garbage-collection policy needs production-scale work |
| Patch helper relocation and vendored tarballs | Bun fails to create nested additions while applying the EVE patch. All 35 new nested modules now live at package root with exact import aliases | Fresh-cache Bun install, runtime imports and TypeScript resolution pass. Remove only when supported tooling installs equivalent files reliably |
| Legacy runtime and scaffold vendoring | Removed from the application and generated app contract | The standalone `@chat-js/thread` package and its documentation remain independently maintained |
| Acceptance suite/model drift | Work progressed in many validated slices; some older tests still reference GPT-4.1 aliases | Normalize obsolete fixtures and maintain a runnable low-cost acceptance manifest; a historical pass does not guarantee an old script runs unchanged today |
| Documentation drift | Some upstream drafts and patch notes were written before later implementation | Reconcile stale “remaining work” sections before using them as release notes; e.g. comparisons/OAuth now have later passing evidence |
| Local-only observability/supervision | Development reliability was needed immediately | Hosted worker supervision, metrics, alerting, incident response and SLOs remain deployment work |

The MCP SDK patch coordinates one transport; the application database lock also coordinates independent clients. An upstream per-transport fix alone is not a reason to remove the cross-client credential-rotation protection.

Patch ownership and rebuild details live in [patches/README.md](../patches/README.md). The [maintained-fork contract](upstream-drafts/eve-fork-runtime-maintenance.md) maps each capability to its requirement, regression boundary and removal condition. The stale comparison/composer and copy-journal integration claims have been corrected. Source-patch application, installed-package integrity and source-to-distribution reproducibility are separate verification gates.

Explicit limits include a 1,000-record fork-checkpoint scan cap, bounded 8 MiB / 50,000-event history restoration, a bounded transcript-copy size, and local filesystem snapshot limits of 20,000 entries / 128 MiB. Unsupported resources, symlinks/special files or missing birth evidence can make a fork/deletion fail closed. Historical sessions created before required checkpoint/identity support cannot be assumed compatible. Microsandbox snapshot capture can interrupt source processes; provider-wide snapshot retention and atomic capture of concurrent background writes are not established.

Billing rounds to cents per turn, preserves known zero costs and records auxiliary model calls separately. Unknown completed costs block new admission pending reconciliation. Already running work can overspend the positive-credit gate. Approval/cancellation remains available at zero credits. This is intentional behavior, not a hard financial budget guarantee.

## Verification evidence

Evidence below combines the latest parity batch and earlier successful checks on the migrated paths. **It is not one clean all-features run on the final commit.** Raw local logs may contain request details and are not uploaded. Filenames below are provenance on the development machine under `/private/tmp` (also `/tmp`), not portable CI artifacts. Test source lives in `apps/chat/tests/`; unit tests are co-located with implementation. A recorded pass only supports the named scenario.

### Latest parity batch

| Verified scenario | Evidence | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| History paging/search and owner isolation; rename/pin persistence | `eve-parity-sidebar-browser.log` | 2 passed |
| Real Gemini response, public read-only sharing, private/foreign denial and revocation | `eve-parity-sharing-browser.log` | 1 passed |
| Project UI/instructions, deliberate error recovery, native response, reload and project deletion preserving chat | Project test in `eve-parity-versions-browser.log` | 1 passed; other tests in this initial batch failed and were subsequently corrected |
| Two native Gemini responses, switching, retained unsent draft and reload | Comparison test in `eve-parity-versions-final.log` | Passed |
| Edit lost-reply recovery, regeneration/model provenance, version navigation, retained/rejected draft | Editing test in `eve-parity-versions-final.log` | Passed; that batch also contained a fork failure |
| Sidebar deletion, durable tombstone and native retirement | Deletion test in `eve-parity-forks-deletion.log` | Passed; fork billing assertion failed in that batch |
| Fork history, source independence, replay/conflict, foreign/raw-source rejection, branch-only billing and family cleanup | `eve-parity-forks-final.log` | 1 passed |
| Repository lint and type checks | `eve-parity-batch-lint.log`, `eve-parity-batch-types.log` | Passed |
| Workspace unit suite | `eve-parity-unit.log` | Passed (7 task groups); run before the final test-only assertion updates |
| ChatJS, EVE and database readiness | `eve-parity-final-health.log` | Healthy after final commit |

### Earlier native/integration acceptance

| Area and exercised contract | Evidence | Qualification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Actual model picker reaches native execution and persists selected model; OAuth callback, encrypted persistence, token refresh and native MCP execution/reload | `eve-sse-final-browser.log` (2 passed) | Real app/EVE/model; OAuth server is a controlled fixture, not every real connector |
| Durable image uploads; multipart send recovery and composer clearing | `eve-file-reference-final-browser.log` (2 passed) | Real native attachment paths; supersedes some failed intermediate runs |
| Code execution, real output and one-time fixed charge | `eve-code-browser-credentials.log` (1 passed) | Credentialed sandbox/provider path |
| Python interactive chart and reload | `eve-code-python-final.log` (1 passed) | Real execution/rendering |
| Document Run, document states, native document creation/revisions/reload/share | `eve-document-run-final.log` (4 passed) | Mixed native and UI-state scenarios; do not count all four as independent provider executions |
| Image generation/editing/stored results/sharing | `eve-native-image-browser-cold.log` (4 passed, includes `eve-image.e2e.ts`) | Native image acceptance plus related scenarios |
| Native deep research, durable report/reload and usage receipt | `eve-live-research24.log` (1 passed) | Native research path; separate renderer tests do not substitute for this |
| Guest admitted creation after lost browser reply, exactly-once native turn and quota | `eve-guest-recovery-browser.log` (1 passed) | Guest auth and native execution, isolated DB |
| Automatic expired guest cleanup and retained billing identity | `eve-scheduler-browser.log` (1 passed) | Local startup scheduler, not production scheduling |
| Internal retirement settles usage after access revocation and retries | `eve-retire-browser-final.log` (1 passed) | Local provider contract |
| Deleting/deleted conversations reject browser access and old creation requests | `eve-deletion-fence-browser-fresh.log` (2 passed) | Access/operation fences, not hosted-provider erasure |

### Additional recorded acceptance

| Scenario | Log evidence | Result / level |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PDF reaches model and opens after reload | `eve-pdf-full-chromium2.log` | 1 passed; native/browser |
| Save a public copy, recover and continue | `eve-copy-ui-browser.log` | 1 passed; native/browser |
| Copied attachments, PDF and imported image edits | `eve-copy-attachment-live.log`, `eve-copy-pdf-live.log`, `eve-copy-png-edit-browser.log`, `eve-copy-image-final.log` | 1 passed each; native/browser, later successes coexist with older failed runs |
| Independent copied documents and native continuation/editing | `eve-copy-documents-live.log` | 1 passed; native/browser |
| Regenerating copied responses with original model provenance | `eve-model-browser.log` | 1 passed; `eve-copy-regeneration-live.e2e.ts` |
| Private votes, reload/error recovery and feedback UI states | `eve-feedback-final-browser.log` | 2 passed; persistence/browser and UI fixtures |
| Follow-up suggestions, normal submission and retained unsent content | `eve-followups-browser.log` | 2 passed; native and UI tests |
| Moving conversations between projects with error recovery | `eve-project-move-verified-browser.log` | 1 passed; browser/local DB |
| Search execution/results | `eve-search-browser.log` | 1 passed; `eve-search.e2e.ts` |
| Guest comparison and guest lifecycle | `eve-guest-comparison-browser.log`, `eve-guest-lifecycle-browser.log` | 1 passed each; native/browser/local DB |
| Registered creation lost-response recovery | `eve-create-recovery-browser-final.log` | 1 passed; browser/native |
| Cancellation and related recovery/retirement/MCP scenarios | `eve-cancel-final-browser.log` | 5 passed; mixed lifecycle batch |
| Tool selection | `eve-tool-selection-browser.log` | 1 passed; selected-tool integration |
| Template/package installation smoke checks | `eve-template-fallback-tests.log`, `eve-bunpacked-tests.log` | 14 pass each; packaging smoke, not proof of patched-world inclusion |

These records are historical scenario evidence, not a claim that every older script runs unchanged against today's catalog. Tests and assertions should be reviewed alongside the log when deciding what to repeat after main integration.

Unit and isolated database contracts additionally exercise authorization, immutable operation hashes, admission races, quota release fencing, cost replay, usage cursors, file reference ownership, document revisions/checkpoints, copy reservations, provider scope/birth evidence, queue inventories and late-write fences, cleanup retries, tool schemas, approval receipt identity and SDK refresh concurrency. Some native harness tests use deterministic models and no provider.

Selected UI tests include desktop/mobile captures, error/pending/empty states and artifact renderers. They do not establish a hosted visual baseline, complete mobile coverage, accessibility compliance or cross-browser compatibility.

## Where gaps could remain

1. **Generated-app deployment breadth.** All three maintained patches now travel with scaffolds. Local archive/install checks do not certify every package manager, target OS or hosted runtime.
2. **Main integration review.** The merge incorporates the 87 previously missing main commits. PR splitting and human review remain separate; final validation results below define what was actually rechecked.
3. **Hosted deployment and production data.** The development-only runtime gate has been removed; release still requires human review. Hosted worker topology, migrations, auth callbacks, secrets, database pools, rollback, provider setup and deletion support need deployment-specific rehearsal. Local Postgres success is not evidence of Neon production behavior.
4. **CI/runtime mismatch.** Workflows now select Node 24, matching the EVE runtime requirement. Playwright uses an ephemeral Postgres service instead of the shared database secret. No dedicated hosted EVE acceptance pipeline was established by the local runs. A green legacy pipeline alone cannot certify this migration; fresh PR CI results must be reviewed separately.
5. **Coverage provenance and fixture drift.** Evidence spans different commits, providers and controlled fixtures. Some old test model IDs and draft notes are stale. Maintain a reproducible acceptance manifest and run the chosen suite after main integration; do not advertise a numerical “100% coverage” claim.
6. **Scale and storage.** Large/long conversations, many concurrent sessions, checkpoint growth, comparison fan-out, database transfer, queue backpressure and long-duration recovery have not been load/soak-certified. Existing bounds reject unsupported work but do not prove acceptable production capacity.
7. **Provider uncertainty.** Lost sandbox-create replies, changed credential scope, unavailable cleanup APIs and incomplete birth evidence can leave deletion pending. A provider 404 or timeout is not automatically proof of non-allocation. This is documented behavior requiring operational handling.
8. **Backend portability.** Snapshot/deletion evidence is scoped to implemented local providers. Other EVE worlds/sandbox backends, hosted erasure guarantees, snapshot retention and recovery across mixed runtime versions need work.
9. **MCP and approvals.** OAuth refresh is exercised end to end with a fixture; native approval receipt invariants have harness tests. This does not certify arbitrary remote servers, all conditional-policy changes or every compiled restart/resume path. The pinned SDK does not provide a universal server-driven approval policy contract.
10. **User experience breadth.** Chromium and selected responsive states are exercised. Safari/Firefox, full keyboard/screen-reader audits, Electron packaging/runtime behavior, every model/file/tool combination and a hosted visual-baseline run are not claimed.
11. **Explicitly deferred scope.** Historical ChatJS conversation import remains deferred by product decision. Video remains disabled and has no live paid-provider end-to-end acceptance claim. PR splitting, production cutover and release approval remain separate steps.

## Upstream reports and review order

Unpublished drafts are in [docs/upstream-drafts](upstream-drafts): batch stream positions, compaction usage, checkpoint readiness, MCP approval policy, pending cancellation, public conversation copy, session deletion, Sandbox allocation reconciliation and Postgres stream transfer. The SDK SSE refresh draft is in [patches/ai-sdk-mcp-sse-refresh.issue.md](../patches/ai-sdk-mcp-sse-refresh.issue.md). Publishing this ChatJS PR does not publish those issues to upstream repositories. Some drafts need updating against later fixes before approval to send them.

Recommended review sequence:

1. Architecture boundaries, production gate and intended product differences.
2. Maintained EVE/world/SDK patches and their reproducible packaging.
3. Auth/admission/guest quotas/billing and the deletion/resource-fence protocol.
4. Native UI, branches/comparisons/copies, files/documents and tool adapters.
5. Main integration, CI/Node alignment, acceptance manifest and staged deployment rehearsal before considering production cutover.

## Integration with main: review notes

- Main remains pinned to `4584f093` (re-fetched during validation). The branch uses main’s formatting, typed gateway boundary, installed standard AI SDK tools, optional capability configuration and third-party registry extension points.
- EVE installs each selected tool set once. Its context adapter carries cancellation, progress, costs, owned attachment writes and sandbox ownership to installed tools. Public renderers come from the installed registry.
- Tavily/Firecrawl SDK calls do not expose an abort option. Cancelling EVE work stops consumption, but may not terminate an already-issued provider request.
- Lint sorting exposed a persisted-data hazard: changing object/schema key order changes admission and copy hashes. Serialization modules retain their original order, with explicit exceptions and regression fixtures for creation/comparison replay bytes. Sequential lock acquisition, bounded cleanup and stream reads also retain documented local exceptions.
- Explicit `undefined` arguments remain permitted by lint because React refs, promise resolvers and typed mocks require them. Removing them produced real type failures.
- Fresh Bun dependency installation succeeds after relocating nested EVE patch modules. Existing workspace links from the previous isolated dependency layout had to be refreshed; no runtime state or databases were deleted.
- No Neon calls, production activation or upstream issue publication is part of this integration. Existing historical evidence above remains historical; the final integration check results below supersede earlier merge/readiness claims.

The isolated database initially inherited `Europe/London`; it is now configured for UTC, matching the UTC timestamp convention used by the app. The database contract suite then passed 75 tests across six files. The same suite caught an in-place sort accidentally changed to an unused `toSorted` return; deletion now returns the sorted family explicitly.

The actual worker startup check caught a framework dependency that unit tests did not: installed tools imported Next.js model-cache code while EVE evaluated them outside Next.js. The integration provides optional model services through tool context, while the web app retains its normal provider defaults. Standalone comparison/response-card browser galleries pass at desktop and mobile sizes, including keyboard selection, recovery and retained composer state.

## Main integration verification

The integration was checked against main `4584f093`, using Node 24 and isolated local Postgres. These checks supplement the earlier feature evidence; they do not imply every historical provider scenario was rerun.

- App unit suite: 131 files, 608 tests passed.
- Workspace `bun lint` passed, including the 83-page documentation check. Workspace `bun test:types` passed all seven tasks without a production build.
- CLI unit suite: 81 tests passed, including scaffold selection and patched-package vendoring.
- Final template sync/check passed for chat and Electron. Fresh empty-tool scaffold and built-in selection contracts passed; the empty scaffold type-checks the renderer boundary. Registry build/reference-consumer checks passed.
- Database contracts: 75 tests across six files passed against local Postgres, covering admission, guests, response groups, copy journals, files and Postgres stream resume.
- Runtime supervisor/health tests: 17 passed. Gateway tests: 14 passed. Thread tests: 68 passed.
- Fresh-cache EVE patch installation passed with Bun 1.3.11 and CI's Bun 1.3.1. Installed files match the expected patched tree; forward/reverse application and runtime helper imports passed.
- A real Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite conversation executed the installed word-count tool, rendered its result, cleared the composer and retained the transcript/tool result after reload. Next.js reported no compilation, configuration or browser-session errors at that checkpoint.
- CI uses Node 24. Playwright owns an ephemeral Postgres service instead of the shared Neon database; the first post-merge hosted Playwright run passed.

The live browser check also identified media renderer precedence: the generic EVE platform renderer could hide the installed image/video renderer. Validated installed renderers now take precedence, with the durable EVE envelope unwrapped at that boundary. The image renderer also has a meaningful input-streaming state in both the app and canonical registry. All eight optimistic-send and tool-renderer browser tests pass, including attachment recovery, desktop/mobile results, image/video progress and failures, research, MCP and public projections. The separate comparison/response-card browser suite passed both tests.

The first post-merge CI run exposed dependency-layout assumptions that the existing local install hid: template vendoring read root `node_modules` directly, and native contract tests imported SDK internals through root-relative paths. Packaging now resolves dependencies from the declaring workspace, test-only aliases support workspace-local and hoisted installations, and the Postgres test driver/types are explicit development dependencies. Isolated package installation is a separate check from a fresh installation of the entire monorepo; both matter for release validation.

A fresh monorepo snapshot with a clean Bun 1.3.1 cache and frozen lockfile passed all seven workspace type-check tasks, all 608 app unit tests, all 82 CLI unit tests and CLI packaging after these fixes. The snapshot contained no environment files or runtime state.

The downstream gateway-selection matrix then exposed missing registry schema files and assumptions that optional tools were always installed. Registry items now include their schemas, EVE accepts empty/narrowed installed tool sets, and sandbox cleanup is a non-enumerable capability supplied by the installed code-execution tool. Cleanup requires no provider when there are no durable resources; existing resource records block deletion if the capability is absent. Provider identity and confirmed-absence checks remain enforced before ownership records are released. Gateway fixtures derive valid model IDs from the selected gateway defaults instead of hard-coding Vercel IDs.

After those fixes, all six independently installed gateway cases passed under Bun 1.3.1: Vercel, OpenAI, OpenAI-compatible, OpenRouter, LiteLLM and a third-party registry. The app suite passed 613 tests; focused cleanup/capability tests passed 26, CLI units passed 82, all seven workspace type-check tasks passed, and lint/template consistency checks passed. The comparison browser fixture was rerun and reviewed at desktop/mobile sizes.

Strict npm installation then exposed peer-version drift hidden by Bun: the vendored EVE archive now declares the microsandbox 0.6 SDK used by the maintained lifecycle integration. The CLI continues to normalize Better Auth versions when producing standalone apps. Peer checks remain enabled; no force/legacy-peer-deps installation workaround is used. The generated pnpm build-script allowlist also includes EVE’s `cbor-extract` dependency, allowing its native acceleration to install without disabling pnpm’s build policy.

With the archive metadata corrected, a CLI-generated standalone app installed successfully through npm with normal peer checks. The archive metadata regression test brings CLI coverage to 83 passing tests; lint, all seven type-check tasks and template consistency also passed.

## Historical architecture-review cleanup

The migration packaging and test counts in this section predate the EVE-only baseline described above.

The maintainer confirmed that only isolated local development databases had applied the unreleased EVE migration sequence. Migrations `0046`–`0072` are consolidated into `0046_eve_runtime.sql` and one final snapshot. Fresh databases migrate from main directly; the exact completed old-history marker preserves existing schema/data while Drizzle records the new migration. Partial histories fail before mutation and have an explicit transition procedure in the then-current migration instructions.

Disposable in-memory PostgreSQL checks compare the complete old sequence with the consolidated migration, including column types/defaults/nullability, constraint definitions and indexes. The catalogs match. Permanent tests exercise the real Drizzle migrator for fresh, completed-old and partial-old histories, including preserved data and migration high-water marks.

Delivery acknowledgement now uses the proxy-owned operation ID in durable message metadata. A tested delivery hook owns pending-state persistence, acknowledgement, rejection and release; the UI retains its composer and non-message command controls. Content/sequence/attachment matching and its obsolete tests are removed. For registered follow-up sends, operation IDs correlate acknowledgements; they do not provide server-side dispatch idempotency for repeated raw POSTs. The UI never automatically resends an uncertain delivery. The generic EVE post-cancellation reader workaround remains until the EVE-layer contract can replace it safely. This reduces overlapping recovery logic without claiming that all runtime-fork debt is gone.

The model catalog is byte-identical to main. Source and compiled runtime patches remain intentionally separate. Approval-receipt source that was absent from the readable patch set has been reconstructed, and the maintenance contract explicitly records the remaining native-test/build-equivalence gates. Upstream drafts remain unpublished.

Cleanup validation: `bun lint`, all seven workspace type-check tasks, 619 app tests and 83 CLI tests pass; generated chat/Electron templates are synchronized. The offline browser fixture exercises the real delivery hook through pending, reload, unrelated/exact acknowledgement, rejection and draft restoration; its three captures were inspected. The reconstructed EVE source builds declarations and JavaScript under Node 24, and its rebuilt approval modules pass the four existing approval security contracts. The isolated source build reused the local pnpm store. Full source-to-distribution equivalence after packaging relocation, clean-cache source reproduction and native upstream test placement remain explicit fork release gates.

The broader test-inclusive EVE `typecheck` was also attempted and fails in older patched source fixtures (snapshot versions, seed/prefix authenticator types, a fork-test binding, and compaction/public-channel types). These failures are outside the reconstructed approval code, but they remain fork-maintenance work. Production source builds passing is not a claim that the entire upstream source test suite is healthy.
