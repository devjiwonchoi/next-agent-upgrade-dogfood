Build standard registry JSON from tested TypeScript sources using shadcn. Use shadcn for gateway/tool installation and generate typed registrations from local tool descriptors. Add `chat-js sync` and separate custom registration modules.

Registry v1 publishes `dist/r/`; historical v0 npm artifacts keep their legacy format. Publish registry v1 and gateway contracts before promoting the CLI. Remove `--registry`, `--no-install`, `--package-manager`, and `paths.tools` in favor of standard namespaces, immediate installation, package-manager detection, and explicit registry targets. Known legacy built-in registrations migrate on sync.
